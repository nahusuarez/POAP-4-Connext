# POAP-4-Connext
I have been into the web3 rabbit hole for at least 6 months and until now I have not done anything away from reading & trading until this moment where I challenged myself with some design for your project. I hope you enjoy these creations. 
I will create three templates to give to the Connext community for their support.
The idea was you can edit the fields relative to year, contributors, rol and even the Connext logo in case you need for a possible network rebranding.
